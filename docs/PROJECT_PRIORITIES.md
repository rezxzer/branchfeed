# Project Priorities - Essential Features Only

ეს დოკუმენტაცია განსაზღვრავს პროექტის პრიორიტეტებს - მხოლოდ ძირითადი ფუნქციები, ზედმეტების გარეშე.

> 📖 **Detailed MVP scope described in `docs/ESSENTIAL_FEATURES.md`** – this file only defines priority order.

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **MVP First**: Build minimum viable product first
2. **Essential Only**: Remove all non-essential features
3. **One Feature at a Time**: Complete one feature before starting another
4. **Document as You Go**: Document each feature when completed

## 🚫 What NOT to Build (Yet)

### Don't Build These Until MVP is Complete:

- Advanced search
- Multiple feed types
- Premium features
- Admin dashboard
- Chat system
- Stories
- Analytics dashboard
- Complex filtering
- Social features (unless core)

### Why?

- **Focus**: MVP should be simple and focused
- **Time**: These features take time away from core functionality
- **Complexity**: They add unnecessary complexity
- **Testing**: More features = more testing needed

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Code is written and tested
- [ ] TypeScript errors are fixed
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Feature works in browser
- [ ] Error handling is implemented
- [ ] Loading states are added

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Start with Phase 1**: Don't skip to Phase 2 until Phase 1 is complete
- **One Feature at a Time**: Complete one feature fully before starting another
- **Test as You Go**: Don't wait until the end to test
- **Document as You Go**: Update documentation when you add features
- **Ask Questions**: If unsure if a feature is essential, check this document first
- **BranchFeed Core**: Remember - branching stories are the core feature, not just regular posts with comments
